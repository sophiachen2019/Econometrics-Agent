    Use Ordinary Least Square Regression method to estimate Average Treatment Effect (ATE) of

    The estimated ATE is the parameter of the treatment variable in the regression model.
    NOTE THAT THIS FUNCTION DOES NOT RETURN THE FINAL REGRESSION TABLE! All tables can (and only can) be printed out during the function.
    If user specifies any fixed effect variable, in the OLS method this variable MUST BE transformed into dummy variables first (with one of the categories dropped to avoid multicollinearity with the constant term) and added into covariates.
    The final return is some clearly specified parameter or statistic within the regressions, or some regression model object within the function (by adjusting the argument input "target_type").

        weights (pd.Series or None): Weights for data samples. If user does not specify any weight specification, the methodology will be standard OLS and this input should be None. If user specifies sample weights, the model will become Weighted Least Squares (WLS), a generalized version of OLS. 
        cov_info (str or dict): The covariance estimator used in the results. Four covariance estimators are supported: If no adjustment, input "nonrobust"; If heteroskedasticity-consistent adjustment (allows "HC0", "HC1", "HC2", "HC3"), take "HC0" as example, input "HC0", and if user specifies to use "robust" standard errors, input "HC1"; If heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent adjustment (HAC) with integer lag terms, take maxlags equal to 5 for example, input {"HAV": 5}; If cluster adjustment with the target groups variable named "groups" (pd.Series or pd.dataframe), input {"cluster": groups}.
        target_type (str or None): Denote whether this function need to return any specific evaluation metric or any other content. If only want to print out regression tables, this should be None. Otherwise, three possible inputs are supported: "neg_pvalue" for the regression treatment variable coefficient p-value's negative value, "rsquared" for the adjusted R-squared value of the regression, and "final_model" for the final regression model.

    Use Instrument Variable - Two Step Least Square (IV-2SLS) method to estimate Average Treatment Effect (ATE) of 
    the treatment variable towards the dependent variable, while ruling out endogeneiry in the original model.
    The estimated ATE is the parameter of the treatment variable in the second-step regression model.
    NOTE THAT THIS FUNCTION DOES NOT RETURN THE FINAL REGRESSION TABLE! All tables can (and only can) be printed out during the function.
    If user specifies any fixed effect variable, in the IV-2SLS method this variable MUST BE transformed into dummy variables first (with one of the categories dropped to avoid multicollinearity with the constant term) and added into covariates.
    The final return is some clearly specified parameter or statistic within the regressions, or some regression model object within the function (by adjusting the argument input "target_type").

    Args:
        dependent_variable (pd.Series): Target dependent variable, which should not contain nan value.
        treatment_variable (pd.Series): Target treatment variable, which should not contain nan value.
        IV_variable (pd.Series or pd.DataFrame): Proposed instrument variable(s). Could have only one or multiple IVs. Should not contain nan value.

Four covariance estimators are supported: If no adjustment, input "nonrobust"; If heteroskedasticity-consistent adjustment (allows "HC0", "HC1", "HC2", "HC3"), take "HC0" as example, input "HC0", and if user specifies to use "robust" standard errors, input "HC1"; If heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent adjustment (HAC) with integer lag terms, take maxlags equal to 5 for example, input {"HAV": 5}; If cluster adjustment with the target groups variable named "groups" (pd.Series or pd.dataframe), input {"cluster": groups}.
        target_type (str or None): Denote whether this function need to return any specific evaluation metric or any other content. If only want to print out regression tables, this should be None. Otherwise, three possible inputs are supported: "neg_pvalue" for the regression treatment variable coefficient p-value's negative value, "rsquared" for the adjusted R-squared value of the regression, and "final_model" for the final second-step regression model.

    Use Difference-in-Difference Regression method to estimate Average Treatment Effect (ATE) of 
    the treatment variable towards the dependent variable, in the PANEL DATA format. This is the STAGGERED version, 
    denoting that there could be multiple time spot when different entities in the treatment group are being gradually treated. In other word, it's not the static method.
    Also, this is the event study version, denoting that there should be enough amount of different treatment implementation time spots (more than see_back_length + see_forward_length).
    NOTE THAT THIS FUNCTION DOES NOT RETURN THE FINAL REGRESSION TABLE! All tables can (and only can) be printed out during the function.
    The final return is some clearly specified parameter or statistic within the regressions, or some regression model object within the function (by adjusting the argument input "target_type").
    
    Args:
        dependent_variable (pd.Series): Target dependent variable, which should not contain nan value. The index of the series should be entity-time multi-index.
        entity_treatment_dummy (pd.Series): A dummy variables series denoting whether the treatment HAS BEEN implemented towards the entity in the timeslot. This input should not contain nan value. The index of the series should be entity-time multi-index.
        covariate_variables (pd.DataFrame or None): Proposed covariate variables. If user does not specify any covariate variable, this could be None. Otherwise, it should not contain nan value.
        entity_effect (bool): Denote whether entity effect is included in the regression.
        see_back_length (int): A positive int denote the length of see-back observation. 
        see_forward_length (int): A positive int denote the length of see-forward observation. 
        time_effect (bool): Denote whether time effect is included in the regression.
        other_effect (pd.DataFrame or None): Denote whether other effects are included in the regression. If there are other effects required, this input should be a pd.DataFrame with the categorial variable column(s) and entity-time multi-index. If no other effects required, leave this input to be None.
        cov_type (str): The covariance estimator used in the results. Five covariance estimators are supported: "unadjusted" for homoskedastic residual, "robust" for heteroskedasticity control, "cluster_entity" for entity clustering, "cluster_time" for time clustering, and "cluster_both" for entity-time two-way clustering.
        target_type (str or None): Denote whether this function need to return any specific evaluation metric or any other content. If only want to print out regression tables, this should be None. Otherwise, three possible inputs are supported: "neg_pvalue" for the regression treatment variable coefficient p-value's negative value, "rsquared" for the adjusted R-squared value of the regression, and "final_model" for the final regression model.
        output_tables (bool): Denote whether this function need to print out regression tables. If want to print out the tabels, this should be True. If only want the evaluation metric outputs, this should be False.

    Use Two-step Fuzzy Regression Discontinuity Design (Fuzzy RDD) Local Linear Regression approach to estimate Average Treatment Effect (ATE) of 
    the treatment variable towards the dependent variable. This is the Fuzzy version, denoting that there could be higher possibility, 
    but not for sure, for an entity with treatment variable above the cutoff to receive the final treatment. In other word, it's not the Sharp method.
    If user specifies any fixed effect variable, in the Fuzzy RDD method this variable MUST BE transformed into dummy variables first (with one of the categories dropped to avoid multicollinearity with the constant term) and added into covariates.
    NOTE THAT THIS FUNCTION DOES NOT RETURN THE FINAL REGRESSION TABLE! All tables can (and only can) be printed out during the function.
    The final return is some clearly specified parameter or statistic within the regressions, or some regression model object within the function (by adjusting the argument input "target_type").

        dependent_variable (pd.Series): Target dependent variable, which should not contain nan value.
        entity_treatment_dummy (pd.Series): A dummy variables series denoting whether the treatment is implemented towards the entity. This input should not contain nan value.
        running_variable (pd.Series): Target running variable to determine the possibility for the entity to receive treatment, which should not contain nan value.
        covariate_variables (pd.DataFrame or None): Proposed covariate variables. If user does not specify any covariate variable, this could be None. Otherwise, it should not contain nan value.
        running_variable_cutoff (float): Denote the threshold of the treatment variable, above which the entity will have higher chance to receive the final treatment.
        running_variable_bandwidth (float or None): Denote the bandwidth to consider in this study. If use full sample (i.e., no bandwidth selection in the task), this should be None.
        kernel_choice (str): Denote the choice of kernel function used in this analysis. Default is "uniform" that gives equal weights to all samples in the dataset. Can also accept "triangle" and "Epanechnikov".
        cov_info (str or dict): The covariance estimator used in the results. Four covariance estimators are supported: If no adjustment, input "nonrobust"; If heteroskedasticity-consistent adjustment (allows "HC0", "HC1", "HC2", "HC3"), take "HC0" as example, input "HC0", and if user specifies to use "robust" standard errors, input "HC1"; If heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent adjustment (HAC) with integer lag terms, take maxlags equal to 5 for example, input {"HAV": 5}; If cluster adjustment with the target groups variable named "groups" (pd.Series or pd.dataframe), input {"cluster": groups}.
        target_type (str or None): Denote whether this function need to return any specific evaluation metric or any other content. If only want to print out regression tables, this should be None. Otherwise, two possible inputs are supported: "estimator" for final Fuzzy RDD estimator towards the causal effect of the treatment variable, and "final_models" for the two-step regression models in a list, with the first one as the first-step model and the second one as the second-step model.
        output_tables (bool): Denote whether this function need to print out regression tables. If want to print out the tabels, this should be True. If only want the evaluation metric outputs, this should be False.
