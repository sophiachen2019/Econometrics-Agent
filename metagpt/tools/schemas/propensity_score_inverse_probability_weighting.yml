description: 'Use propensity score inverse probability weighting (IPW) method to estimate
  the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), or Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT),
  of the treatment variable towards the dependent variable. This method is formally
  called Propensity Score Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) approach. The final
  return is the final estimated ATE or ATT as is required. Could refer to: hhttps://psantanna.com/Econ520/Slides/15-ipw/15slides.html#1 '
signature: (dependent_variable, treatment_variable, propensity_score, target_type='ATE')
parameters: 'Args: dependent_variable (pd.Series): Target dependent variable, which
  should not contain nan value. treatment_variable (pd.Series): Target treatment variable,
  which should be a binary variable with no nan value (1 for treatment, 0 for control).
  propensity_score (pd.Series): Propensity score for each sample to receive treatment,
  which should not contain nan value. target_type (str): Target output type, which
  supports "ATE" and "ATT".'
