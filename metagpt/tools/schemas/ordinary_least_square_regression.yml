description: 'Use Ordinary Least Square Regression method to estimate Average Treatment
  Effect (ATE) of the treatment variable towards the dependent variable. The estimated
  ATE is the parameter of the treatment variable in the regression model. NOTE THAT
  THIS FUNCTION DOES NOT RETURN THE FINAL REGRESSION TABLE! All tables can (and only
  can) be printed out during the function. If user specifies any fixed effect variable,
  in the OLS method this variable MUST BE transformed into dummy variables first (with
  one of the categories dropped to avoid multicollinearity with the constant term)
  and added into covariates. The final return is some clearly specified parameter
  or statistic within the regressions, or some regression model object within the
  function (by adjusting the argument input "target_type"). '
signature: (dependent_variable, treatment_variable, covariate_variables, weights=None,
  cov_info='nonrobust', target_type='final_model', output_tables=False)
parameters: 'Args: dependent_variable (pd.Series): Target dependent variable, which
  should not contain nan value. treatment_variable (pd.Series): Target treatment variable,
  which should not contain nan value. covariate_variables (pd.DataFrame or None):
  Proposed covariate variables. If user does not specify any covariate variable, this
  could be None. Otherwise, it should not contain nan value. weights (pd.Series or
  None): Weights for data samples. If user does not specify any weight specification,
  the methodology will be standard OLS and this input should be None. If user specifies
  sample weights, the model will become Weighted Least Squares (WLS), a generalized
  version of OLS. cov_info (str or dict): The covariance estimator used in the results.
  Four covariance estimators are supported: If no adjustment, input "nonrobust"; If
  heteroskedasticity-consistent adjustment (allows "HC0", "HC1", "HC2", "HC3"), take
  "HC0" as example, input "HC0", and if user specifies to use "robust" standard errors,
  input "HC1"; If heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent adjustment (HAC)
  with integer lag terms, take maxlags equal to 5 for example, input {"HAV": 5}; If
  cluster adjustment with the target groups variable named "groups" (pd.Series or
  pd.dataframe), input {"cluster": groups}. target_type (str or None): Denote whether
  this function need to return any specific evaluation metric or any other content.
  If only want to print out regression tables, this should be None. Otherwise, three
  possible inputs are supported: "neg_pvalue" for the regression treatment variable
  coefficient p-value''s negative value, "rsquared" for the adjusted R-squared value
  of the regression, and "final_model" for the final regression model. output_tables
  (bool): Denote whether this function need to print out regression tables. If want
  to print out the tabels, this should be True. If only want the evaluation metric
  outputs, this should be False.'
