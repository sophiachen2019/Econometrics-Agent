description: 'Use Sharp Regression Discontinuity Design (Sharp RDD) Local Linear Regression
  approach to estimate Average Treatment Effect (ATE) of the treatment variable towards
  the dependent variable. This is the Sharp version, denoting that entities with treatment
  variable above the cutoff will receive the final treatment FOR SURE. In other word,
  it''s not the Fuzzy method. If user specifies any fixed effect variable, in the
  Sharp RDD method this variable MUST BE transformed into dummy variables first (with
  one of the categories dropped to avoid multicollinearity with the constant term)
  and added into covariates. The estimated ATE is the parameter of the entity treatment
  dummy in the regression model. NOTE THAT THIS FUNCTION DOES NOT RETURN THE FINAL
  REGRESSION TABLE! All tables can (and only can) be printed out during the function.
  The final return is some clearly specified parameter or statistic within the regressions,
  or some regression model object within the function (by adjusting the argument input
  "target_type"). '
signature: (dependent_variable, entity_treatment_dummy, running_variable, covariate_variables,
  running_variable_cutoff, running_variable_bandwidth, kernel_choice='uniform', cov_info='nonrobust',
  target_type='final_model', output_tables=False)
parameters: 'Args: dependent_variable (pd.Series): Target dependent variable, which
  should not contain nan value. entity_treatment_dummy (pd.Series): A dummy variables
  series denoting whether the treatment is implemented towards the entity. This input
  should not contain nan value. running_variable (pd.Series): Target running variable
  to determine the possibility for the entity to receive treatment, which should not
  contain nan value. covariate_variables (pd.DataFrame or None): Proposed covariate
  variables. If user does not specify any covariate variable, this could be None.
  Otherwise, it should not contain nan value. running_variable_cutoff (float): Denote
  the threshold of the treatment variable, above which the entity will have higher
  chance to receive the final treatment. running_variable_bandwidth (float or None):
  Denote the bandwidth to consider in this study. If use full sample (i.e., no bandwidth
  selection in the task), this should be None. kernel_choice (str): Denote the choice
  of kernel function used in this analysis. Default is "uniform" that gives equal
  weights to all samples in the dataset. Can also accept "triangle" and "Epanechnikov".
  cov_info (str or dict): The covariance estimator used in the results. Four covariance
  estimators are supported: If no adjustment, input "nonrobust"; If heteroskedasticity-consistent
  adjustment (allows "HC0", "HC1", "HC2", "HC3"), take "HC0" as example, input "HC0",
  and if user specifies to use "robust" standard errors, input "HC1"; If heteroskedasticity
  and autocorrelation consistent adjustment (HAC) with integer lag terms, take maxlags
  equal to 5 for example, input {"HAV": 5}; If cluster adjustment with the target
  groups variable named "groups" (pd.Series or pd.dataframe), input {"cluster": groups}.
  target_type (str or None): Denote whether this function need to return any specific
  evaluation metric or any other content. If only want to print out regression tables,
  this should be None. Otherwise, three possible inputs are supported: "neg_pvalue"
  for the regression treatment variable coefficient p-value''s negative value, "rsquared"
  for the adjusted R-squared value of the regression, and "final_model" for the final
  regression model. output_tables (bool): Denote whether this function need to print
  out regression tables. If want to print out the tabels, this should be True. If
  only want the evaluation metric outputs, this should be False.'
