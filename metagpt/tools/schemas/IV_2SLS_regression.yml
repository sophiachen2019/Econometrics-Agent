type: function
description: 'Use Instrument Variable - Two Step Least Square (IV-2SLS) method to
  estimate Average Treatment Effect (ATE) of the treatment variable towards the dependent
  variable, while ruling out endogeneiry in the original model. The estimated ATE
  is the parameter of the treatment variable in the second-step regression model.
  NOTE THAT THIS FUNCTION DOES NOT RETURN THE FINAL REGRESSION TABLE! All tables can
  (and only can) be printed out during the function. If user specifies any fixed effect
  variable, in the IV-2SLS method this variable MUST BE transformed into dummy variables
  first (with one of the categories dropped to avoid multicollinearity with the constant
  term) and added into covariates. The final return is some clearly specified parameter
  or statistic within the regressions, or some regression model object within the
  function (by adjusting the argument input "target_type"). '
signature: (dependent_variable, treatment_variable, IV_variable, covariate_variables,
  cov_info='nonrobust', target_type='final_model', output_tables=False)
parameters: 'Args: dependent_variable (pd.Series): Target dependent variable, which
  should not contain nan value. treatment_variable (pd.Series): Target treatment variable,
  which should not contain nan value. IV_variable (pd.Series or pd.DataFrame): Proposed
  instrument variable(s). Could have only one or multiple IVs. Should not contain
  nan value. covariate_variables (pd.DataFrame or None): Proposed covariate variables.
  If user does not specify any covariate variable, this could be None. Otherwise,
  it should not contain nan value. cov_info (str or dict): The covariance estimator
  used in the results. Four covariance estimators are supported: If no adjustment,
  input "nonrobust"; If heteroskedasticity-consistent adjustment (allows "HC0", "HC1",
  "HC2", "HC3"), take "HC0" as example, input "HC0", and if user specifies to use
  "robust" standard errors, input "HC1"; If heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation
  consistent adjustment (HAC) with integer lag terms, take maxlags equal to 5 for
  example, input {"HAV": 5}; If cluster adjustment with the target groups variable
  named "groups" (pd.Series or pd.dataframe), input {"cluster": groups}. target_type
  (str or None): Denote whether this function need to return any specific evaluation
  metric or any other content. If only want to print out regression tables, this should
  be None. Otherwise, three possible inputs are supported: "neg_pvalue" for the regression
  treatment variable coefficient p-value''s negative value, "rsquared" for the adjusted
  R-squared value of the regression, and "final_model" for the final second-step regression
  model. output_tables (bool): Denote whether this function need to print out regression
  tables. If want to print out the tabels, this should be True. If only want the evaluation
  metric outputs, this should be False.'
