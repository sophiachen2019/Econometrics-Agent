type: function
description: 'Use propensity score double robust IPW regression adjustment method
  to estimate Average Treatment Effect (ATE) of the treatment variable towards the
  dependent variable. This method is formally called Propensity Double Robust Estimator
  (IPW Regression Adjustment) approach. NOTE THAT this function is the DOUBLE ROBUST
  version! The ATE is the coefficient of the target treatment variable in the final
  OLS regression. The estimated ATE is the parameter of the treatment variable in
  the regression model. NOTE THAT THIS FUNCTION DOES NOT RETURN THE FINAL REGRESSION
  TABLE! All tables can (and only can) be printed out during the function. The final
  return is some clearly specified parameter or statistic within the regressions,
  or some regression model object within the function (by adjusting the argument input
  "target_type"). Can refer to: https://www.stata.com/manuals/teteffectsipwra.pdf '
signature: (dependent_variable, treatment_variable, covariate_variables, propensity_score,
  cov_type=None, target_type='final_model', output_tables=False)
parameters: 'Args: dependent_variable (pd.Series): Target dependent variable, which
  should not contain nan value. treatment_variable (pd.Series): Target treatment variable,
  which should be a binary variable with no nan value (1 for treatment, 0 for control).
  covariate_variables (pd.DataFrame): A dataframe of covariate variables, which should
  not contain nan value or intercept. propensity_score (pd.Series): Propensity score
  for each sample to receive treatment, which should not contain nan value. cov_type
  (str or None): The covariance estimator used in the results. If not specified by
  user, this could be None. NOTE THAT if user specifies to use "robust" standard errors,
  this input should be "HC1"! target_type (str or None): Denote whether this function
  need to return any specific evaluation metric or any other content. If only want
  to print out regression tables, this should be None. Otherwise, three possible inputs
  are supported: "neg_pvalue" for the regression treatment variable coefficient p-value''s
  negative value, "rsquared" for the adjusted R-squared value of the regression, and
  "final_model" for the final regression model. output_tables (bool): Denote whether
  this function need to print out regression tables. If want to print out the tabels,
  this should be True. If only want the evaluation metric outputs, this should be
  False.'
