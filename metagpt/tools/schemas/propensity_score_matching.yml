description: 'Use propensity score matching method to estimate the Average Treatment
  Effect (ATE), or Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) of the treatment
  variable towards the dependent variable. This method is formally called Propensity
  Score Matching (PSM) approach. Note that the method allows sampling with replacement,
  as well as equal weighting when matched_num is larger than 1. The final return is
  the final estimated ATE or ATT as is required. Could refer to: https://www.stata.com/manuals/teteffectspsmatch.pdf '
signature: (dependent_variable, treatment_variable, propensity_score, matched_num=1,
  target_type='ATE')
parameters: 'Args: dependent_variable (pd.Series): Target dependent variable, which
  should not contain nan value. treatment_variable (pd.Series): Target treatment variable,
  which should be a binary variable with no nan value (1 for treatment, 0 for control).
  propensity_score (pd.Series): Propensity score for each sample to receive treatment,
  which should not contain nan value. matched_num (int): The amount of nearest neighbors
  considered for each treatment entity. Should be an positive integer no smaller than
  1. target_type (str): Target output type, which supports "ATE" and "ATT".'
