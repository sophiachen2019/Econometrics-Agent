description: 'VISUALIZE propensity score distribution for treatment group and control
  group and compare their distributions. The ideal result is that treatment group
  and control group should distribute similarly across propensity score. One common
  scenario is treatment group has most sample with propensity score close to 1 and
  control group has most sample with propensity score close to 0. In this scenario,
  the best solution is to trim samples with extreme propensity scores and obtain a
  subsample with similarly distributed propensity score. '
signature: (treatment_variable, propensity_score)
parameters: 'Args: treatment_variable (pd.Series): Target treatment variable, which
  should be a binary variable (1 for treatment, 0 for control). propensity_score (pd.Series):
  Propensity score for each sample to receive treatment, which should not contain
  nan value.'
