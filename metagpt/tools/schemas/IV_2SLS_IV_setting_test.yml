type: function
description: 'Test the fundamental assuptions that the proposed Instrument Variable
  should satisfy, which are: 1. Relevant Condition: In the proposed population model,
  the proposed IV should be relevant with the target treatment variable; 2. Exclusion
  Restriction: In the proposed population model, the proposed IV should not be relevant
  with the residual of this model. '
signature: (dependent_variable, treatment_variable, IV_variable, covariate_variables,
  cov_type=None)
parameters: 'Args: dependent_variable (pd.Series): Target dependent variable, which
  should not contain nan value. treatment_variable (pd.Series): Target treatment variable,
  which should not contain nan value. IV_variable (pd.Series): Proposed instrument
  variable. Could have ONLY ONE IV in this test function. Should not contain nan value.
  covariate_variables (pd.DataFrame or None): Proposed covariate variables. If user
  does not specify any covariate variable, this could be None. Otherwise, it should
  not contain nan value. cov_type (str or None): The covariance estimator used in
  the results. If not specified by user, this could be None.'
