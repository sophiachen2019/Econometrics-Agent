description: 'Use propensity score double robust augmented IPW method to estimate
  Average Treatment Effect (ATE) of the treatment variable towards the dependent variable.
  This method is formally called Propensity Double Robust Estimator (Augmented IPW)
  approach. NOTE THAT this function is the DOUBLE ROBUST version! NOTE THAT THIS FUNCTION
  DOES NOT RETURN THE FINAL REGRESSION TABLE! All tables can (and only can) be printed
  out during the function. The final return is the final estimated ATE. Can refer
  to: https://www.stata.com/manuals/teteffectsaipw.pdf '
signature: (dependent_variable, treatment_variable, propensity_score, covariate_variables,
  cov_type=None)
parameters: 'Args: dependent_variable (pd.Series): Target dependent variable, which
  should not contain nan value. treatment_variable (pd.Series): Target treatment variable,
  which should be a binary variable with no nan value (1 for treatment, 0 for control).
  covariate_variables (pd.DataFrame): A dataframe of covariate variables, which should
  not contain nan value or intercept. propensity_score (pd.Series): Propensity score
  for each sample to receive treatment, which should not contain nan value. cov_type
  (str or None): The covariance estimator used in the results. If not specified by
  user, this could be None. NOTE THAT if user specifies to use "robust" standard errors,
  this input should be "HC1"!'
