type: function
description: 'Visualize the Staggered Difference-in-Difference Event Study result.
  Note that this function needs the regression result from the previously defined
  function "Staggered_Diff_in_Diff_Event_Study_regression()", and need to set the
  input parameters "see_back_length" and "see_forward_length" well matched with the
  regression result. '
signature: '(regression_model, see_back_length: ''int'' = 4, see_forward_length: ''int''
  = 3)'
parameters: 'Args: regression_model (linearmodels.PanelOLS): The regression model
  returned from the previously defined function "Staggered_Diff_in_Diff_Event_Study_regression()",
  with the input ''target_type == "final_model"''. see_back_length (int): A positive
  int denote the length of see-back observation. see_forward_length (int): A positive
  int denote the length of see-forward observation.'
