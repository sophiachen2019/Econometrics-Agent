description: 'Use Difference-in-Difference Regression method to estimate Average Treatment
  Effect (ATE) of the treatment variable towards the dependent variable, in the PANEL
  DATA format. This is the STAGGERED version, denoting that there could be multiple
  time spot when different entities in the treatment group are being gradually treated.
  In other word, it''s not the static method. The estimated ATE is the parameter of
  the entity treatment dummy in the regression model. NOTE THAT THIS FUNCTION DOES
  NOT RETURN THE FINAL REGRESSION TABLE! All tables can (and only can) be printed
  out during the function. The final return is some clearly specified parameter or
  statistic within the regressions, or some regression model object within the function
  (by adjusting the argument input "target_type"). '
signature: (dependent_variable, entity_treatment_dummy, covariate_variables, entity_effect=True,
  time_effect=True, other_effect=None, cov_type='unadjusted', target_type='final_model',
  output_tables=False)
parameters: 'Args: dependent_variable (pd.Series): Target dependent variable, which
  should not contain nan value. The index of the series should be entity-time multi-index.
  entity_treatment_dummy (pd.Series): A dummy variables series denoting whether the
  treatment HAS BEEN implemented towards the entity in the timeslot. This input should
  not contain nan value. The index of the series should be entity-time multi-index.
  covariate_variables (pd.DataFrame or None): Proposed covariate variables. If user
  does not specify any covariate variable, this could be None. Otherwise, it should
  not contain nan value. entity_effect (bool): Denote whether entity effect is included
  in the regression. time_effect (bool): Denote whether time effect is included in
  the regression. other_effect (pd.DataFrame or None): Denote whether other effects
  are included in the regression. If there are other effects required, this input
  should be a pd.DataFrame with the categorial variable column(s) and entity-time
  multi-index. If no other effects required, leave this input to be None. cov_type
  (str): The covariance estimator used in the results. Five covariance estimators
  are supported: "unadjusted" for homoskedastic residual, "robust" for heteroskedasticity
  control, "cluster_entity" for entity clustering, "cluster_time" for time clustering,
  and "cluster_both" for entity-time two-way clustering. target_type (str or None):
  Denote whether this function need to return any specific evaluation metric or any
  other content. If only want to print out regression tables, this should be None.
  Otherwise, three possible inputs are supported: "neg_pvalue" for the regression
  treatment variable coefficient p-value''s negative value, "rsquared" for the adjusted
  R-squared value of the regression, and "final_model" for the final regression model.
  output_tables (bool): Denote whether this function need to print out regression
  tables. If want to print out the tabels, this should be True. If only want the evaluation
  metric outputs, this should be False.'
